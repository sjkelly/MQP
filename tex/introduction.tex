\chapter{Introduction}

Our objective is to develop a computational environment for the exploration
of parametric polytopes. Since a polytopes is assembled from simpler
primitives we will nessecarily develop these as well. Along our way, we
will hopefully see dichotomies and parallels in out mathemetical
classifications that reveal better structures.

To begin, we will define what it means in geometric and mathematical
terminology to be a polytope. We will seek to apply this type definition
in a way that is useful to both a programmer and a mathematician.
Such challenges in application are well known in
the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field. \cite{Tognazzini_1993}
How ever we approach this not an issue in the genre of the media,
but a strucutral one. As such, our media is computer code and we
will illustrate that the foundations in lamda calculus and
type theory are sufficient for our representations.

Finally we will demonstrate the preliminaries of our system.
