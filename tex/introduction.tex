\chapter{Introduction}

Our objective is to develop a computational environment for the exploration
of parametric polytopes. A computational environment is one in which
we can apply rigourous defintional constraints on symbolic constructions, and
likewise manipulate them to reveal properties that may be of interest.
A parametric polytope is the union of two concepts. The first is the idea
of parameters, which are our unknown constraints in a system. A polytope
is a geometric object that has "flat" sides. The purpose of this paper
is to illucidate the prior work in computational representations of polytopes
and develop this work further.
